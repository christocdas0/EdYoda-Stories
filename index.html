                help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online

                learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine
                attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that

                Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses
                statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to
                “learn” (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific
                task) from data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of
                how efficiently (or not) Gmail detects spam emails, or how good
                text-to-speech has become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and
                Google Home. Some of the tasks that can be solved by
                implementing Machine Learning include: An

                “An income share agreement (or ISA) is a financial structure in
                which an individual or organization provides something of value
                (often a fixed amount of money) to a recipient who, in exchange,
                agrees to pay back a percentage of their income for a fixed
                number of years.” Too much jargon? Lets simplify the context.
                Income Share Agreement (abbreviated to ISA) is basically a
                financial contract agreement signed between an individual and an

                Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to
                gather and analyze information from the Internet. Some websites
                and platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs)
                which we can use to access information in a structured way, but
                others might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard
                way of interacting with todays popular platforms, we dont always
                have this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on
                the internet. Rather than reading data from standard API
                responses, well need to find the data ourselves by reading the
                websites pages and feeds.
